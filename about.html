  <p>My name is Ido Tuchman and I am the founder of Busylabs.</p>
  <p>Building robots is a fun way to learn science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). However, traditional robot kits are very expensive. I want to enable every student to learn robotics.</p>
  <p>We provide affordable, 3D printable robot kits. Our kits use inexpensive, off-the-shelf electronics to keep costs down. With an initial investment in a 3-D printer, schools can print as many plastic robot parts as needed. If a part breaks, simply print a new one. All software and 3-D files for our robots are open source and can be downloaded for free. Finally, our robots are wi-fi enabled so schools can use their existing technology to program and control the robots.</p>
  <p>We are still prototyping robots and hope to release our first kit by the end of 2018. Please join our mailing list to be informed of new developments.</p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Ido Tuchman</p>
